    "#### 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "> Educational testing remains a fundamental practice for different stakeholders who need to make evidence-based decisions, whether for formative, summative, selection, or certification purposes. However, the larger the number of individuals to be assessed, the more complex, time-consuming, and expensive are the processes for obtaining evidence about the knowledge and learning developed by these individuals (Liu et al, 2016; Zhang, Shah & Chi, 2016). In this regard, some technological advances have allowed educational testing to become increasingly faster, inexpensive, and effective, such as automatic short answer grading (ASAG), the focus of this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Short answer is a particular case of constructed response questions, which have the advantage to assess complex thinking and reasoning when compared to multiple choice questions. Although constructed response questions have traditionally been used sparingly in both classroom and large-scale assessments due to cost and time implications (Liu et al, 2016; Ramesh & Sanampudi, 2021), AGAS has proven to be a viable (and crucial) solution for e-learning and intelligent tutoring systems to make intensive use of this type of question nowadays. Although the advances in the use of AGAS are numerous and significant (Hanh et al, 2021), there are still few studies that have investigated, for example, the quality of scores when automatically grading Elementary or Middle School Science questions. Moreover, there are special concerns with students developing knowledge and skills in STEM area, which includes Scientific Literacy (OECD, 2016). Therefore, my proposal seeks to contribute methodologically to the area of ASAG, as well as conceptually to the area of science learning."

    "#### 2. Related Work \n",
    "\n",
    "> Hanh et al. (2021) have investigated the state of the effects of automatic scoring and/or feedback by analyzing 125 studies published in journals and proceedings between 2016 and 2020. Some of the trends that they observed were: 1) Most of the work reviewed were at the bachelor’s or equivalent level, with small numbers at the early educa-tion (2% of papers), and secondary education (6% of pa-pers). 2) 47% of the papers fell into the categories of the sciences, including areas like geology, mathematics, com-puter science, computer networking. 3) Regarding the types of automatic scores and feedback, 51% of the papers used structured inputs (mathematics, code, or controlled envi-ronments such as simulations), only 2% used short an-swers , 14% used essays, and 33% used others (i.e., virtual reality, handwriting, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Liu et al. (2014) investigated the accuracy of c-rater, a concept-based automatic scoring systems developed by Educational Testing Service (ETS) for scoring science inquiry questions that had complex rubrics. For c-rater scoring, one or more model responses were identified, and their linguistic features were analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Such linguistic features were then applied to evaluate students’ responses to determine the presence or absence of key concepts. The researchers scored four questions using the sys-tem and got moderate to good agreement between automated and human scores. They also identified a few challenges in using the concept-based scoring method, such as the long time to identify the key concepts, being almost impossible to identify them exhaustively, and the relationship between analytic and scoring rubrics was not fully specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, Liu et al. (2016) studied the accuracy of c-rater-ML, an enhanced version of the c-rater that used support vector regression to model the relationship between students’ responses and scores. The system was effective in scoring science items with five-point scoring rubrics, showing reasonable agreement with human scoring for all test takers as well as specific subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The research to date reveals the potential of ASAG in Science. However, so far, among the few studies found, most were focused on ETS products, which are not open-source, and the content of the questions used, as well as the answers graded are not public (if they were, maybe would help to demystify the lack of \"faith\" that some stakeholders have about AGAS (Burrows et al., 2015)). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Additionally, there are new methods in the field of NLP and Machine Learning (ML) that have not been tested yet. Therefore, we understand that further research with other databases, exploring traditional or new NLP/ML methods may help to disseminate the potentialities of ASAG and further substantiate the field."

    "#### 3.1 Definition of Short Answer Questions and Overview of the Science Questions Investigated \n",
    "\n",
    "> In conducting the literature review, we noticed the importance of distinguishing between short and long answer questions (or essays), since the latter type is mostly used in the area of Language to assess aspects of writing, such as coherence, syntax, style, etc., which impacts the goal of the scoring process. Therefore, using the same definition as Burrows, Gurevych, & Stein (2015), in this paper short answer questions are those: \n",
    "> 1) in the form of natural language; \n",
    "> 2) requiring students to recall external knowledge that is not provided by the question; \n",
    "> 3) of which the length ranges between one phrase to one paragraph; \n",
    "> 4) focusing on the correctness of the content rather than the style; and \n",
    "> 5) and are closed, which means that the answers have to match the specific facts corresponding to questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two science questions used in our study meet this definition. These questions are part of a bank of questions used in 6th grade Comprehensive Science exams administered by an online public school that provides K-12 instruction to students in one of the US states. The exams were mostly composed of short constructed response questions, and their data range from 2017 to 2022. Due to confidentiality reasons, we cannot present the exact content of the Science questions used in this study, but only outline the skills they measure. Using the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in science as a reference, question 1 is related to the core idea of \"Forces and Interactions\" and measures the standard \"MS-PS2-4. Construct and present arguments using evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions are attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects\", while question 2 is related to the core ideas of \"Weather and Climate\" and partially measures \"MS-ESS2-4. Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth’s systems driven by energy from the sun and the force of gravity\" because it requires only a description/explanation rather than the development of a model."

    "#### 3.2 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our training and testing corpus consists of textual responses to the two Science questions. Question 1 had a total sample size of 203 responses with an average length of 27 words/response, while Question 2 had a total sample size of 118 responses with an average length of 37 words/response. Originally, each response was manually scored by the online public school teachers, however, due to a mismatch among the columns of the dataset, it was not possible to associate the scores with the students' responses. Therefore, based on other data that was available in the database (teachers' feedbacks regarding student responses), we elaborated new rubrics for the two Science questions and used three codes to categorize the responses: 0 for incorrect, 1 for partially correct, and 2 for completelly correct. These three categories served as labels for our supervised classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regarding the distribution of responses per category, initially we had a higher percentage of completely correct responses, but since this could bias the classifiers, we then randomly dropped some correct responses until they represented 50% of each sample. In the end, we got approximately the same proportional distribution of responses for both questions: 17% incorrect, 33% partially correct and 50% completelly correct."

    "> First, we conducted some of the steps in standard NLP pre-processing: lowercasing and replacing abbreviated with complete forms. We did not remove punctuation neither tokenized the sentences into words because the vectorizer function that we used (CountVectorizer() from package sklearn) did these steps by default. We also did not lemmatized, nor stemmed the sentences, but in a future study we will conduct tests with those conditions and analyze the impacts on the classifiers accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After the pre-processing, our text data was vectorized (i.e. converted into numerical data) using Bag-of-Words (BOW). The next step, similar to prior research on ASAG (Burrows et al., 2015), we tested three classical classifiers – Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, and Support Vector - splitting each of our two samples randomly into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and running our tests 5 rounds for each sample to get an average accuracy for each classifier."

    "> As we can see, the accuracies of the three classifiers were higher for Q1 than for Q2 probably due to the larger number of responses for Q1. We know that the larger the corpus, the more words will compose BOW and, consequently, we will have less sparsity in the vectors and a better prediction. For both questions, SVC had the highest accuracy. Despite the high accuracies (above 0.70) of the classifiers for Q1 responses, the interpretation of these values needs to take into account that the responses to both questions were, in general, similar and that BOW does not capture the context of the sentences. For example, responses such as the ones below may have been  classified as correct (code 2) because they both have the keywords expected in a correct response, but clearly only one is correct. \n",

    "> The results obtained in this study can add more evidence to the body of studies that have been conducted on AGSA, especially regarding its use with Science questions. Despite a small sample size, an accuracy of 70% is not negligible, although it still needs to be better analyzed in light of other metrics. Since the other Science questions used in the exams of this online school probably don't have as much variability of responses, part of the scoring that is currently conducted manually by the teachers could be done automatically, perhaps on an experimental basis.\n",
